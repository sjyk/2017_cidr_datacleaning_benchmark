\section{Introduction}
Preparing and cleaning datasets prior to analysis is a perennial challenge in data analytics. As it has become easier to acquire and store ever larger datasets, the challenges associated with large-scale data cleaning, wherein issues caused by incorrect, missing, and duplicate data are identified and repaired, are of interest to both industry and academia. The result has been a several new systems, algorithms, abstractions, and interfaces for data cleaning --- however, there does not exist a unified evaluation methodology for either research or practice. This paper describes a number of problems in data cleaning and proposes new techniques to evaluate and benchmark data cleaning.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Describe the problems that we are addressing
    \item Describe the types of data errors
    \item Describe the types of cleaning software
    \item Describe the applications and potential utility to the world.
